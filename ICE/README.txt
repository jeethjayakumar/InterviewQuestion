1. Read a double precision number (from stdin) and print the smallest number that is larger than 95% of numbers encountered so far   Run program on input size = 128,000,000 and provide the time taken. Provide the time take for this random input along with the    solution.
2. You have a set of parquet tiles of size 3x1 and 2x1 length units. Parquet tiles are alwyas laid out in strips, for instance 
   3223 is a strip of length 10. When 2 strips are adjacent, no two tiles can share an inner edge. For instance, strips 3223 and
   3322 both start with a 3 so they don't share inner edges. Write a C/C++ program that does the following:
   Find the total nummber of flooe designs which have 11 strips of length 30. Provide the answer and time taken with the solution
