1. Given a bound of N, output all the numbers of form 2^i*5^j in increasing order and without duplicates.

2. Given a @D array of size MxN, how many ways are there to go from (0,0) to (M-1, 0) given available moves from (x,y) are
   (x+1,y+(1,0,-1))
   
   (0,N-1)(1,N-1)(2,N-1)......(M-1,N-1)
   ....................................
   (0,0)(1,0)(2,0...............(M-1,0)
