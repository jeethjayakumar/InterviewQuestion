1. The greatest common divisor (GCD), also called highest common factor (HCF) of N numbers is the largest positive integer that 
   divides all numbers without giving a remainder.
   Write an algorithm to determin the GCD of N positive integer.
   Input : num=5 , arr=[2,4,6,8,10] ; Output: 2

2. Given an array of the locations of N packing crates, implement an algorithm to find the locations of the M crates closest to
   the truck.
