1. Implement a class called AirMap that has two methods:
   -> add_route(start, dest) : adds a ONE-WAY connecting flight from start to destination
   -> print_all_routes(start, dest) : prints all possible routes from start to destination irrespective
   Given the following flight routes, print all possible routes between airports C and D

   Input: 
   A ----> B
   B ----> A
   A ----> C
   C ----> A
   A ----> D
   D ----> A
   B ----> C
   C ----> B
   B ----> D
   D ----> B
   A ----> E

   Output: C,A,B,D

2. Given a list of strings, write a function to return list of only uniq strings from that input list.
   Eg: Input: {"dog","cat","bat","rat","cat","pig","dog"} ; Output: {"bat","rat","pig"}

3. Given a list of IPs, write an algorithm to find the IP in the list. If the IP is present, print "IP found" else print
   "IP not found". Write a better algorithm other than find() that C++ STL provides.
